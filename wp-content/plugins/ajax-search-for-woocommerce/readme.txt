2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to `WooCommerce -&gt; AJAX Search bar` and set your preferences.
4. Use a shortcode `[wcas-search-form]` or go to the `Appearance -&gt; Menu` and add menu item `AJAX Search bar` or go to the `Appearance -&gt; Widgets` and choose `AJAX Search bar`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to embed the search bar in my theme? =
There are five easy ways to display the search bar in your theme:

– **As a menu item** - go to the `Appearance -&gt; Menu` and add menu item `AJAX Search bar`.
– **By shortcode**

`[wcas-search-form]`

– **As a widget** - go to the `Appearance -&gt; Widgets` and choose `AJAX Search bar`.

– **By PHP** - use following code in your theme templates:

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[wcas-search-form]'); ?>`

– **We will do it** -  our WordPress Developer will do it for you after upgrade to the Pro version.

Or insert this function inside php file ( often it used to insert form inside page templates files ):

= How to replace the existing search bar in my theme with AJAX Search? =

*  Storefront
*  Flatsome

We offer free replacing the search bar in your theme after upgrade to the Pro version.

= Can I add a search bar as an element of the WordPress menu? =
**Yes, you can!** Go to `Appearance -&gt; Menu`. There is a new menu item called `AJAX Search box`. Select it and click `Add to menu` button.

= I have a question, where do I ask? =
You can create a support ticket on our website via [contact form](https://ajaxsearch.pro/contact/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=asfw&utm_content=contact&utm_gen=utmdc). Also, we answer the questions on the [WordPress Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ajax-search-for-woocommerce/).

= Do you offer customization support? =
Sometimes the search bar requires minor improvements in appearance. It depends on what theme you use. We guarantee fast CSS corrections for all Pro plugin users, but we also help Free plugin users.

= Where are the plugin settings? =
Go to `WooCommerce -&gt; AJAX Search bar`. The plugin's settings page is a submenu of the WooCommerce menu item.

= Who is the Pro plugin version for? =
The Pro plugin version is for all online sellers who want to **increase sales** by providing an ultra-fast and intelligent search engine to your clients.

The main difference between Pro and Free plugin versions is speed and search scope. The Pro plugin version has a new fast and smart search engine. For some sellers with a lot of products, the search speed can be increased **up to 10x**. It's a whole new experience.

So the Pro plugin version is dedicated to all WooCommerce shops, where the autocomplete suggestions work too slow.
